```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload upon saving changes to the source files. To open the applocation directly wit hthe serve command use the option '-o'

## Code Generation

```bash
ng generate component <component-name>
ng generate directive <directive-name>
ng generate pipe <pipe-name>
ng generate service <service-name>
ng generate class <class-name>
ng generate guard <guard-name>
ng generate interface <interface-name>
ng generate enum <enum-name>
ng generate module <module-name>
```

Replace `<element-name>` with the desired name for the respective Angular element.

```bash
ng build
```

The generated build artifacts will be located in the `dist/` directory.
